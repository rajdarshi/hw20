        <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p class="small ">
            This project started while speaking to one of my family friends and her experience driving her electric
            vechile with her family on stormy snowy day during christmas long vacation from the Bay area to LA. She
            mentioned it was a nightmare because she was not able to locate a hotel or charging station because of a
            blackout in the area (Snowstorm in LA is rare). Most of the charging stations were closed and hotels were
            full.

                <p class="small">As the electric transformation in the mobility space is accelerating at a fast pace,
                    Certain segments of EV drivers who like long multi-stop commute, there is a need for providing
                    confidence from range anxiety and enhanced en route experience like overnight stay with EV charging
                    facilities and also live enroute charging stops guidance.

        <h4>Why a robust Research Plan is important in the beginning of the project?</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="small">Research plan is a way to start conversation with users in a systematic and in interesting
            direction and taking note of comments and valuable insights. I started the research plan with identifying
            research objectives and statement. Overall this research plan is basically a document that outlines the
            where, why, who, how and what of the project. The methodology I followed during my 1:1 user interview was “5
            Whys”.

        <h4>In-person user interview</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="small">In-person user interview is key to get user insight. I conducted a few user interviews with
            both EV owners and prospective buyers at the showroom and online surveys. The goal was to understand each
            individual user's needs and to get the most specific requirements and their expectations.

        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Recruited participant</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="small">The participants we interviewed were mainly current EV owners from Tesla and other OEMs who
            frequently use their vehicles for both longer multi-stop commutes. We will also be interviewing a few
            prospective owners as well. These prospective buyers will help us to understand their aspirations connected
            to owning EV.

        <h4>Here what i learned from my Online user survey</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="small">UX surveys are the easiest and quick way to find data from potential users. This user survey
            was the part of the qualitative study with both closed and open questions. After user interview, I also
            conducted online survey dividing survey in two broader category. First is EVs are the driving factor or long
            distance drive? and second, how user want their EVs to be charged.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="small">The most important take way was to have more and more charging station and it absolutely
            doesn't mater if it is free or paid or community based. One of the best things I found during the UX survey
            was the diverse range of responses. I received a total 34 responses. Few things which came loud and clear
            are

        <ul class="list-unstyled small">

            <ul>
                <li>Users plan their route based on availability of charging stations which I find a limiting factor for
                    road trips.</li>

                <li>Almost ~ 65% of users want a charging station at their stay location during travel</li>

                <li>Free charging stations are desirable.</li>

                <li>Google map is most accepted travel app!</li>

            of similar items to then further analyze the data. I personally have given chunking of the data as blocking
            data which falls under a similar situation. The way I started here is with a braindump from an interview and
            survey with user insights and pain points.

        <h4>Guerrilla Usability testing plan</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="small">I planned user testing using the wireframe to hear the user's reaction and feedback on
            navigation usability and products features. This also made me understand where we match and stand with the
            user's expectations. Method I used here is Guerrilla usability testing which involves rapid testing without
            recruiting users in advamce. <br><br> I approached members in the parking lot and supermarket to get real
            world actionable feedback.
            Interestingly we also get perspective and opinion on visual design, layout and color themes. I made notes of
            all the insights, action and expectation in order to iterate the design for the next phase.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>


        <h4>Iterate User flow</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="small">Based on all improvements the final design is the combination of the best option for the user
            with incorporating clarity and freindliness while using the product.
            I put a lot more focus on creating an enhanced user onboarding experience.

        <h4>Hi fidelity iOS wireframe</h4>

        <p class="small">Based on task flow and user flow analysis, then further refining initial ideas. I created Lofi
            wireframes with the best option to cater to user needs. I created a prototype in figma for user testing.
            This initial prototype allowed us to test the navigation and usability in real life scenarios with users.
            This also helps us to build the understanding of our design language and how components and layouts should
            look and flow while the user is navigating through the product.

        <h4>Key learnings</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="small">The importance of user testing– Importantly I feel conducting usability testing with real users
            at various stages helped me to identify and rectify the major pain points which I consider roadblocks.
            Research methodology– The beauty of the research methodology is to help designers to build an important base
            for product design. It helped me to produce important data and insights. Proper research methodology make
            our effort more effective and valuable at every stage of the design process.
            <br><br>

            Identifying the right persona – I think deep understanding of the right persona is fundamental for creating
            a high quality product. Persona also hep us to find the answer of most important questions.
